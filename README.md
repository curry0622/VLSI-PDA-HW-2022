# NTHU CS6135 VLSI Physical Design Automation (2022 Fall)

## HW1: P&R Tool

In this homework, you are asked to use **Cadence Innovus** to complete the P&R (Place and Route) flow for a given synthesized standard-cell design. The goal is to acquaint you with Innovus and the P&R flow. Besides, you are encouraged to try to optimize timing, total area of chip, and total wire length without violating any timing or DRC constraints.

## HW2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning

In this homework, you are asked to implement **Fiducciaâ€“Mattheyses Algorithm** to solve the problem of  two-way  min-cut partitioning.
