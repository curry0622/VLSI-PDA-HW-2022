# NTHU CS6135 VLSI Physical Design Automation (2022 Fall)

## HW1: P&R Tool

In this homework, you are asked to use **[Cadence Innovus](https://www.cadence.com/ko_KR/home/tools/digital-design-and-signoff/soc-implementation-and-floorplanning/innovus-implementation-system.html#)** to complete the P&R (Place and Route) flow for a given synthesized standard-cell design. The goal is to acquaint you with Innovus and the P&R flow. Besides, you are encouraged to try to optimize timing, total area of chip, and total wire length without violating any timing or DRC constraints.

## HW2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning

In this homework, you are asked to implement **"[Fiduccia–Mattheyses Algorithm](https://limsk.ece.gatech.edu/course/ece6133/project/FM.pdf)"** to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## HW3: Fixed-outline Slicing Floorplan Design

In this homework, you are asked to adapt and implement an existing algorithm, published in the **DAC-86** paper entitled **"[A New Algorithm for Floorplan Design](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1586075)"** by Wong and Liu, for solving the fixed-outline slicing floorplan design problem with a set of hard blocks.

## HW4: Placement Legalization

In this homework, you are asked to adapt and implement an existing algorithm, published in the **ISPD-08** paper entitled **“[Abacus: fast legalization of standard cell circuits with minimal movement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1353629.1353640)”** by Spindler, Schlichtmann and Johannes, to legalize a given global placement result with minimal total displacement (measured by Euclidean distance).

## HW5: Automated P&R for Analog Circuit

In this homework, you are asked to write programs to place and route some analog circuits, and you need to output the results in the DEF (Design Exchange File) format.
